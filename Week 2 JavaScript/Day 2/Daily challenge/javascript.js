 /*
 Daily Challenge : Not Bad
Create a string that has the word “not” and “bad” inside
Create another variable that should find the first appearance of the substring “not” and “bad”.
If the ‘bad’ follows the “not”, then it should replace the whole “not”…”bad” substring with ‘good’ than console.log the result.
If it doesn’t find “not” and “bad” in the right sequence (or at all), just console.log the original sentence.
Example:

 Your string is : 'This dinner is not that bad!', the result is : 'This dinner is good!'
  Your string is : 'This movie is not so bad!' the result is : 'This movie is good!'
  Your string is : 'This dinner is bad!' the result is : 'This dinner is bad!'
